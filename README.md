# Super Tiny Social Icons
Under 1KB each! Super Tiny Social Icons are miniscule SVG versions of your favourite logos

They are designed for a 512x512 viewbox - but should scale up and down to suit your needs.

Built using [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo)

Originally designed for my contact page - https://edent.tel/
