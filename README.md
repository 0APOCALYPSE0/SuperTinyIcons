# Super Tiny Social Icons
Under 1KB each! Super Tiny Social Icons are miniscule SVG versions of your favourite logos

They are designed for a 512x512 viewbox - but should scale up and down to suit your needs.

Originally designed for my contact page - https://edent.tel/

## Can you go smaller?

Yes! These files were minified using [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and then hand edited.  Further smallification is possible.

Each of these has an `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` in the `<svg>` tag. This isn't strictly necessary - but some web browsers won't display them as an image without it.

Newlines can be stripped - they've been kept for readability where possible.

Rounded corners can be dropped - `rx="15%" ry="15%"` - the effect can be done in CSV if you want.

The background colour can also be excluded if you're including it elsewhere.

The precision of the paths is *mostly* 0 decimal places. A few logos have 1 or 2 dp to make them look more accurate. The precision can be dropped if necessary.
